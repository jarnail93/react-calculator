# React Calculator

A simple Calculator made with React only (one with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) will be made separately). It is made while I'm learning [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).

Using it fairly simple. Clone it and just run. Nothing special for on-boarding.

## Libraries used

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- It uses [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS only)
- A beatiful icons library used is [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). we've only used Bootstrap icons so far.
- To speedup development, we've used [mathjs's](https://mathjs.org/) expression engine, instead of writing a (poor)one.

### Task List (or shortcomings)

- [ ] Currently, the whole calculator is re-rendring on every button click and change in display
- [ ] Advacned calcultor (a simple one, similiar to what we get on mobile phone's default calculator)
